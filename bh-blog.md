# First Day of School
## A New Challenge
Today is **DAY ONE** of remote study here at Epicodus. \*First impressions\*... _so this is what the deep end feels like_. 

You never truly know how much you _don't know_, but today I feel like I'm standing on the precipice of my own understanding with a flashlight in hand, on the edge of a vast, exciting darkness taking baby steps and dropping bread crumbs along the way. 

This is honestly the most out of my depth that I have ever felt and I'm oddly, _thankfully_, ok with that.

I'm sure tomorrow will bring more than a few new challenges, not the least being remembering the things I learned today. 

Anyway, here's to moving forward unafraid of the mistakes I'm going to make along the way and eager for the new skills I will develope because of them.
